    <h2>1. Data We Process</h2>
    <h3>1.1. Photos</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What We Access:</strong> The app uses your device camera to capture photos within the app.</li>
        <li><strong>What Happens to Your Photos:</strong> Photos are processed locally on your device. After processing, the resulting image is saved directly to your device’s gallery.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> We do not store or transmit your photos to any server or external service. All processing occurs on your device.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>1.2. App Settings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stored Locally:</strong> The app saves the name of the currently selected film emulation roll locally on your device’s default iOS storage. This data is not personal and is only used to provide a seamless user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Permissions Required</h2>
    <p>To provide functionality, the app requires the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> To capture photos within the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Gallery/Storage:</strong> To save processed photos directly to your device’s gallery.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. User Identification</h2>
    <p>We do not require you to provide any personally identifiable information (e.g., email address, username, or other identifiers). The app does not include user accounts, sign-ups, or logins.</p>
    
    <h3>3.2 User Data Deletion</h3>
    <p>Users can exercise their right to delete their data by simply uninstalling the Klara app from their device. When the app is deleted, all locally stored data will be permanently removed.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>No Sharing: We do not share, sell, or transfer your photos, settings, or any other data to any third party.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>As a user under the GDPR, you have the following rights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access and Information: Since the app does not collect or store your personal data, there is no personal information to access or modify.</li>
        <li>Erasure: The app does not store personal data, so there is no data to delete.</li>
    </ul>
