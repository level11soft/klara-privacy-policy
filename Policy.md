**Privacy Policy**

**Effective Date:** 27/Jan/2025

Klara (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we process user data in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Apple’s App Store privacy requirements.

### 1. **Data We Process**
#### 1.1. **Photos**
- **What We Access:** The app uses your device camera to capture photos within the app.
- **What Happens to Your Photos:** Photos are processed locally on your device. After processing, the resulting image is saved directly to your device’s gallery.
- **Storage:** We do not store or transmit your photos to any server or external service. All processing occurs on your device.

#### 1.2. **App Settings**
- **Stored Locally:** The app saves the name of the currently selected film emulation roll locally on your device’s default iOS storage. This data is not personal and is only used to provide a seamless user experience.

### 2. **Permissions Required**
To provide functionality, the app requires the following permissions:
- **Camera:** To capture photos within the app.
- **Gallery/Storage:** To save processed photos directly to your device’s gallery.

The app does not request or use additional permissions beyond these essential functionalities.

### 3. **User Identification**
- We do not require you to provide any personally identifiable information (e.g., email address, username, or other identifiers).
- The app does not include user accounts, sign-ups, or logins.

### 3.2 User Data Deletion

Users can exercise their right to delete their data by simply uninstalling the Klara app from their device. When the app is deleted, all locally stored data, including personal information and app usage data, will be permanently removed from the user's device. We do not retain any user data after the app has been deleted.

### 4. **Third-Party Services**
- **No Third-Party Analytics or Ads:** This app does not use third-party analytics, ad networks, or any external services that collect user data.

### 5. **Data Sharing**
- **No Sharing:** We do not share, sell, or transfer your photos, settings, or any other data to any third party.

### 6. **Your Rights**
As a user under the GDPR, you have the following rights:
- **Access and Information:** Since the app does not collect or store your personal data, there is no personal information to access or modify.
- **Erasure:** The app does not store personal data, so there is no data to delete.

### 7. **Global Compliance**
This app is made available globally. While the primary compliance framework is the GDPR, we adhere to general privacy principles applicable to other jurisdictions, including California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) where relevant. Users globally are assured that no personal data is collected, stored, or shared.
